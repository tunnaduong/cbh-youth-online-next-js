## First and foremost:

- Dont run `npm run dev` and `npm run build` or any similar commands like `php artisan serve` without my permission
- Never create a new README file for each feature

## Others:

- API routes for client are defined in src/app/Api.js
- Web endpoints for API is http://chuyenbienhoa.test, and for client Next.js is http://locahost:3000
- Never run `php artisan serve`
- If you want to test the API endpoints, just do a `curl` terminal command
- For server side rendering, if you want to access APIs, a specific file is made for you at: src/utils/serverFetch.js. DO NOT try to rewrite manual fetch
- If I attach a whole error log from Vercel builds, dont try to fix the warnings, just fix the errors
